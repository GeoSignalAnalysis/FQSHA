## ‚úÖ 1. Install GMT (Generic Mapping Tools)

1. **Uninstall** any existing GMT 5.x installation if present.
2. Download GMT 6.x from the official website:  
   https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/download/
3. Run the installer and install GMT to:  
   `C:\Program Files\GMT6\`
4. During installation, make sure to **check** the option to  
   **"Add GMT to the system PATH"**.

## ‚úÖ 2. Install Ghostscript

1. Download the latest 64-bit Ghostscript for Windows from:  
   https://ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html
2. Install it to the default directory:  
   `C:\Program Files\gs\gs10.06.0\`
3. Add the following to your system `PATH` environment variable:  
   `C:\Program Files\gs\gs10.06.0\bin`

## ‚úÖ 3. Configure Environment Variable for GMT (if needed)

If PyGMT cannot locate GMT automatically, manually set the following environment variable:

- **Variable name:** `GMT_LIBRARY_PATH`  
- **Value:** `C:\Program Files\GMT6\bin`

## ‚úÖ 4. Clone and Navigate to the FQSHA Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FQSHA.git
cd FQSHA



‚úÖ 5. Set Up the Conda Environment


Option A: Reproduce full environment from .yml file
If you want to install using yml file (fqsha_windows_env.yml), run:

conda env create -f fqsha_windows_env.yml
conda activate fqsha_env


Option B: Manual setup: Without .yml file

conda create -n fqsha_env python=3.10
conda activate fqsha_env
conda install -c conda-forge pygmt openquake pandas
pip install -r requirements.txt


‚úÖ 6. Run the FQSHA Toolkit

You must be inside the extracted package directory (fqsha/). Then, run:


python -m fqsha


‚úÖ 7. Verify Installation (Optional Test)

import pygmt
fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.basemap(region=[0, 10, 0, 10], projection="X10c/10c", frame=True)
fig.show()



## üìù Notes
These commands assume you're using Anaconda Prompt.

If you see ModuleNotFoundError, make sure you're inside the correct directory (fqsha/) and the environment is activated.

The environment has been tested on Windows 11, using:

Python 3.10

GMT 6.5+

Ghostscript 10.06

PyGMT 0.10
